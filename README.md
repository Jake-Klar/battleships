# Battleships

## Introduction
A python implementation of the classic board game. Includes both a singleplayer and multiplayer (vs AI) CLI mode as well as a GUI mode using flask (multiplayer vs AI only). Included are also a range of configuration files that allow you to customize your gameplay experience as well as a few functionality tests.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.11.4

Install flask with pip
```bash
  pip install flask
```
Install setuptools with pip
```bash
  pip install setuptools
```
## Installation
Not necessary to the grader of this project! You can install this project from github. In git bash use

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/imferolla/battleships.git
```

## Getting Started
To begin playing the CLI game, in your terminal change your directory to battleships/battleships and run components.py. For the GUI mode change your directory to the same folder, run main.py and then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/placement. You will also find a placements.json, config.txt and battleships.txt file in that folder. These can be updated to modify your game. Config has some basic game variable options, battleships allows you to modify the amount of ships, their names, and their sizes, and placements allows you to create predetermined ship placements.
